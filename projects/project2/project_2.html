        <p>
          The number of births minus the number of deaths
          (called the "natural increase" by demographers)
          and net migration are the determinants of growth
          for a country. One or both of these components
          can be the driving force of population change,
          depending on the country and the point in time of
          interest. In the United States, net immigration is
          projected to be a predominant factor in our future
          population growth. At levels presumed by the
          Census Bureau's middle projection series (which
          assume net immigration at current levels), immi-
          grants who come to the United States between
          1994 and 2050 and their offspring will be responsi-
          ble for 60 percent of our total population growth
          during that period.

          <p>Another term for immigrants is "legal permanent
            residents." These are the people who hold coveted
            "green cards," which state that they legally reside
            in the United States. This status confers several
            privileges that are unavailable to non-citizens who
            do not hold green cards: those with green cards
            may permanently live and work anywhere in the
            country, own property, attend public schools and
            universities, and join some branches of the armed
            forces. People who apply to become American citi-
            zens are typically legal permanent residents. 17</p>

          <p>Recent concern about immigration to the United
            States has been fueled by the number of immigrants, and the perceived and actual influence that
            immigration exerts on the lives of non-immigrants.
            Historically, immigrants have borne the brunt of
            public scorn when economic conditions worsen.
            However, economic conditions were generally good
            during the 1990s, yet immigration remained a hotly
            contested issue in the media and at various levels
            of government. Part of the reason for this discussion is the differential effect of recent immigration
            on the resident population. Much of the negative
            impact is on minorities, according to some
            research, because the jobs recent immigrants are
            taking are concentrated at the bottom of the ez,
            pational ladder, where minorties are dispropore,
            ately represented.</p>
          <br></br>

          <p>While the level of immigration is high by recent
            standards, the proportion of foreign-born persons in
            the population is not at record levels for the Une
            states. In 2004, about 12 percent of the populai,
            was born abroad, more than double the percert,
            of foreign-born persons in 1970 (about 5 percent
            but less than the figure at the turn of the century
            (about 15 percent).</p>
          <br></br>

          <p>The number of immigrants admitted to the Unites
            States varied considerably throughout the last.per
            of the twentieth century, increasing from about
            600,000 in the mid-1980s to almost two milionin
            1991. After that, the numbers began to decrease.
            dropping to 647,000 in 1999. One major stalisical
            reason for the increase was the Immigration
            Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which permitted
            immigration of former illegal aliens. In 1995, a change
            in the law permitted such persons to apply directly for
            naturalization, thus removing them from the count of immigrants.
            Almost 2.7 immigrants were recorded under IRCA provisions
            between 1989 and 1994; about 75 percent of those
            removed "immigrated" in 1989 and 1990. Another
            reason for the decline was the Immigration Act of
            1990, which placed a "flexible" cap on immigration
            at 700,000 during the 1992-1994 period, and
            675,000 thereafter. After 2000, the numbers again
            began to rise.</p>
            <br></br>

          <p>In fiscal year 2004, about 946,000 immigrants were admitted
            to the United States. Of these, only
            362,000 (38 percent) were actually new arrivals.
            The remaining 584,000 were already residing in
            the U.S. when their status was adjusted. As shown
            in Table 3-9, the largest single category is "immediate
            relatives of U.S. citizens," making up almost
            half the total. In the majority of these cases, the
            spouse is the U.S. citizen. The next major categories are
            family-sponsored immigrants (22.7 percent)
            and employment-based immigrants (164 percent).
            These two groups are "preference" immigrants, primarily
            made up of the spouses, children or siblings of U.S. citizens and people eligible for
            immigration because they have desirable occupations or education. Refugees and asylees are
            another important immigrant group.</p>
            <br></br>

            <p>Beginning in the early 1990s, Congress mandated a
            new "diversity" program, which guaranteed about
            55.000 visas to countries that had been "adversely
            affected" by the 1965 Immigration Act; another 5
            percent of immigrants in 2004 were admitted to the
            United States under this provision. These immigrants were balanced by an estimated
            220,000 persons who left the United States, known as the "emigrants."
            Most immigrants are young, with 40 percent between the
            ages of 25 and 39 years. The youngest are children
            adopted by American parents; they accounted for most of the children under
            5 years old among the immigrant group.</p>
            <br></br>

          <p>During the twentieth century, there was a dramatic
            shift in the countries of origin of immigrants, with
            fewer arriving from Europe and more originating in
            Central America and Asia. As was the case
            throughout the 1990s, Mexico remained the source
            country for the largest group of immigrants (even
            excluding IRCA legalizations, which were also pre-
            dominantly for Mexicans), representing about 18
            percent of all immigrants in 2004. The other top five
            sending countries included the Philippines,
            Vietnam, China, and India. The largest sending area in
            Europe encompassed the republics of the former
            Soviet Union.</p>
            <br></br>

          <p>Immigrants tend to cluster in a relatively small number of states,
            with two-thirds of the 2004 group concentrated in six states:
            California (home to 27 percent of immigrants in 2004), New York (11 percent),
            Texas (10 percent), Florida (8 percent), New Jersey (5 percent), and Illinois (5 percent).</p>
            <br></br>

          <p>It is important to note that a large number of persons
            legally enter the United States each year, but
            are not immediately enumerated as "immigrants" in
            official statistics, despite the fact that many end up
            staying in the United States permanently. Some
            "classes" of persons can "adjust" to permanent status
            (and are thus counted as immigrants) after
            being in the United States for one year (e.g., people
            granted asylum or refugee status). Such persons
            are counted as "immigrants" only after they take
            this adjustment step, even though they may have
            been in the United States for several years. A major
            category of non-immigrant entry is the H-1B visas,
            permitting employers to bring in workers (or to keep
            workers already in the country) to meet employment
            needs that cannot be met by American citizens.
            Most of these jobs are technical in nature and
            require at least a bachelor's degree. The number of
            immigrants in the category has declined in recent
            years, but still amounted to near 400,000 in 2004.
            However, the largest number of foreigners entering
            the country each year (more than 30 million) are
            non-immigrants admitted as temporary visitors, with
            most coming to the United States on vacation or for
            pleasure.</p>
