          The number of births minus the number of deaths
          (called the "natural increase" by demographers)
          and net migration are the determinants of growth
          for a country. One or both of these components
          can be the driving force of population change,
          depending on the country and the point in time of
          interest. In the United States, net immigration is
          projected to be a predominant factor in our future
          population growth. At levels presumed by the
          Census Bureau's middle projection series (which
          assume net immigration at current levels), immi-
          grants who come to the United States between
          1994 and 2050 and their offspring will be responsi-
          ble for 60 percent of our total population growth
          during that period.

          <p>Another term for immigrants is "legal permanent
            residents." These are the people who hold coveted
            "green cards," which state that they legally reside
            in the United States. This status confers several
            privileges that are unavailable to non-citizens who
            do not hold green cards: those with green cards
            may permanently live and work anywhere in the
            country, own property, attend public schools and
            universities, and join some branches of the armed
            forces. People who apply to become American citi-
            zens are typically legal permanent residents. 17</p>

          <p>Recent concern about immigration to the United
            States has been fueled by the number of immi-
            grants, and the perceived and actual influence that
            immigration exerts on the lives of non-immigrants.
            Historically, immigrants have borne the brunt of
            public scorn when economic conditions worsen.
            However, economic conditions were generally good
            during the 1990s, yet immigration remained a hotly
            contested issue in the media and at various levels
            of government. Part of the reason for this discus-
            sion is the differential effect of recent immigration
            on the resident population. Much of the negative
            impact is on minorities, according to some
            research, because the jobs recent immigrants are
            taking are concentrated at the bottom of the ez,
            pational ladder, where minorties are dispropore,
            ately represented.</p>
          <br></br>

          <p>While the level of immigration is high by recent
            standards, the proportion of foreign-born persons in
            the population is not at record levels for the Une
            states. In 2004, about 12 percent of the populai,
            was born abroad, more than double the percert,
            of foreign-born persons in 1970 (about 5 percent
            but less than the figure at the turn of the century
            (about 15 percent).</p>
          <br></br>

          <p>The number of immigrants admitted to the Unites
            States varied considerably throughout the last.per
            of the twentieth century, increasing from about
            600,000 in the mid-1980s to almost two milionin
            1991. After that, the numbers began to decrease.
            dropping to 647,000 in 1999. One major stalisica
            reason for the increase was the Immigration
            Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which per.
            mitted immigration of former illegal aliens. 19 In
            1995, a change in the law permitted such persons
            to apply directly for naturalization, thus removing
            them from the count of immigrants. Almost 2.7
            immigrants were recorded under IRCA provisions
            between 1989 and 1994; about 75 percent of those
            removed "immigrated" in 1989 and 1990. Another
            reason for the decline was the Immigration Act of
            1990, which placed a "flexible" cap on immigration
            at 700,000 during the 1992-1994 period, and
            675,000 thereafter. After 2000, the numbers agan
            began to rise.</p>
