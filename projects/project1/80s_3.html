    <p style="text-align:left; padding: 60px 120px 0px 120px;">The music was more about freedom and expression than about self-entitled egotism. Whether it was anger from the “punks”, hopeful whimsy from the pop stars or just a desire to dance from the Miami Sound Machine; it all enveloped a general view of acceptance and inclusion that hasn't been revisited since. There was more of a willingness to venture out of comfort zones and try new things. Some of those things bombed horribly, but some were fantastic.</p>
