      For this project, I decided to go back to one of my favorite times: The 80's. My parents grew up in the 80's, therefore I would always listen to their favorite music, and the majority came from that time.
      Additionally, it's such a fascinating era for me, as a designer, given that many design influences came from that time, and what better way to showcase some of the most prevalent trends than with a mall, am I right?
