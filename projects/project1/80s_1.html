    <p style="text-align:left; padding: 60px 120px 0px 120px;">There was little left untapped in the color spectrum during the eighties. The brighter the colors and the broader the range the better. From pastels to neon; little was off-limits. It was a visually vibrant decade full of leg-warmers, jelly shoes, ripped midriff shirts, jackets with superfluous zippers and pants with extraneous flaps and folds. An excellent time for self-expression through fashion. And far less cliquish and judgmental than today's fashion trends.</p>
